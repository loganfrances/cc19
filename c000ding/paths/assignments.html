			<p><h4>3 sites examination -</h4></p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong><a href="https://videocollectionorderedbytitlelength.work/">video collection trying to order itself by title length</a></strong> / I really liked this specific website, just because of the fact that it's not necessarily <i>useful</i>. It is a sculptural form, but it isn't 3D. Instead, it makes me think of how the internet is real but also incorporeal. Visually, the website is also engaging because instead of a straight list that is flush left and goes down the page, the web links take on a more organic form that flows across the page. It reminds me of wind going through grass or waves in water. I'm interested in the code the creator used for this, and even further, code that produces natural shapes.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="https://mappingthespirit.com/">mapping the spirit</a></strong> / this site is a very interesting project to me, and I wish it was still active. I'm assuming that the project faltered since the last time any part of the site was updated was a year ago, and there is only one story done so far. However, I think this is an interesting project that explores the diverse experience that black people in America have. The first story, about the moors living in Philly, was done really well. The type of data collected, the drawings and images, and the text looked really good on the website, and I liked the horizontal scrolling rather than vertical.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="https://theinvisiblewalls.btselem.org">The Invisible Walls of Occupation</a></strong> / This site is a good tool. I think the overall summation of the reporting done about Palestine and Israel is really dehumanizing to Palestinians, and also extremely impersonal &#40;which echoes the racism that is engrained in the conflict&#40;. I think this approach to a website, as a technology of connection and justice, is helpful and useful. Additionally, the design of the site is beautiful -- I enjoy the way the pictures are stitched, which allows the viewer to &#39;look around&#39; the scene. The integration of videos and photo is very immersive, and helped the exploration process of each area.</li>
