			<div><p>you really thought that would work? where is your culture? where is your class? where is your respect? you either picked:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>ALL WHITE -- which is really just a silly decision. did you not see bey perform an ode to the black panthers at the superbowl? 
					<li>ROYALTY -- tacky! far too tacky! we know bey is a queen but you don't need to shove it down everyone's throats.</li>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>not only did you pick an ugly set up, but you also gave bey a very heavy breakfast that has caused her to be tired and sluggish. you ruined the concert. you.</p>
