		<h1>you're fired!</h1>
			<div><h4>not sure what you thought was gonna happen to be honest.</h4>
				<p> you really thought that would work? where is your culture? where is your class? where is your respect? you either picked:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>ALL WHITE -- which is really just a silly decision. did you not see bey perform an ode to the black panthers at the superbowl? 
						<li>ROYALTY -- tacky! far too tacky! we know bey is a queen but you don't need to shove it down everyone's throats.</li>
					</ol>
				<p>good job picking breakfast though. maybe consider being a waitress in the future? you could actually be useful.</p>
