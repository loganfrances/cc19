		<h1>reading 003: how to learn css by rachel andrews</h1>
		<div>
			<p style="margin-left: 10%">5 things I learned from this reading:<ol>
				<li>1. selectors - selectors are not just defined by id and class, they can also be chosen (or selected, ha) with other specific labels. In this reading, Andrews uses the example of p:firstchild, which she defines as a pseudo selector. This selector would apply to the first defined p element only, much like if we ha defined it with id="firstchild". I think this process is a bit easier for the person coding, because it doesn't mean everything has to be expolicitly defined, and it also cuts down on time.</li>
				<li>2. pseudo selectors - pseudo selectors can be stacked! this is probably something that you can do in other areas as well, but I haven't seen that yet. For example, p:firstchild can also be followed with :firstline, which applies styles to just the first line of the first parent (end result - p:firstchild::firstline). I want to investigate further how specific/many layers I can create with pseudo selectors, because I think it will save me a lot of time and brain power.</li>
				<li>3. box model - I really had a hard time understanding the "box" idea we discussed in class, and I think this reading kind of helped explain it. I see the box model as a kind of layer cake, and the height of the cake is determined by the margin, border, and padding. I think I have to play with this onscreen more but I think this visualization helps me.</li>
				<li>4. display - I'm actually still confused by this one, but I think I'll just have to see how each display looks as I do more coding. I see that its still following the box model, but I don't understand how flex and inline look.</li>
				<li>5. some other jargon I am adding to my vocabulary - So Andrews used several words in the layout section (flex, multicol, grid) that I wasn't aware of as options you could include in how things layout. I will have to experiment with how these look as compared to float, because it seems like it applies to the same type of look.</li>
				</ol>
			<p style="margin-left: 10%"> 3 questions:<ol>
				<li>1. which tags control similar actions? will need to know so I won't confuse them.</li>
				<li>2. how do css animations work?</li>
				<li>3. is there a limit on the number of specifications you can create?</li>
			</ol>

			<p style="margin-left: 10%">i.	I think the obvious disadvantage of creating a communication method for a limited audience is just that – the audience is limited. Of course, this doesn’t always stand as a disadvantage, but if your goal was to communicate with a wide range of people through a book, article, instruction manual, etc., and you choose a type of language that not many people are privileged to know, then you have technically failed. The advantages to this however, may include saving time and energy by using a language a specific audience is privy to. For example: an astrophysicist might communicate to their fellow astrophysicists using language that involves words and symbols that a chef might not understand. I think interestingly enough, visual communication is pretty universal, except for the fact that people living with sight disabilities would possibly be not able to engage. Which is where other forms of sensory communication come in hand. </p>
			<p style="margin-left: 10%"> ii.	I detest the term “digital native,” but as someone who is web-proficient, I see literacy valued in the spread of opinions/news on social sites. Twitter is a perfect case study. Twitter, the social site which limits its users to 280 characters per tweet, means that someone who is able to tell their opinion/make an argument/debate in fewer tweets is valued more. Which is why I think trolls actually get so far with irking people online: most of their retorts to certain topics are simple, short statements or questions. Twitter is a hellscape where being able to read and write becomes a twisted weapon, and more importantly, being able to misconstrue is valued. 
			In other areas of literacy online, I think my favorite debate that Old People had about the internet is about the shortening of language (ex: lol, lmao, yakwtfgo, etc.). I always found this debate hilarious because it showed there was some bizarre fear about language being deteriorated into a primitive state, and somehow echoed the same debates about “ebonics” and other specific forms of cultural communication. As if somehow, their own existence was threatened by the fact that their english was not the standard.</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 10%">iii.	I was a bit confused by Delaney’s criticisms of hypertext, and then I realized that this talk was from 1998, and how far the internet has come since then. The sheer amount of referential sources online, like .edu sites, scholarly sources, and databases has exponentially expanded since then. So no, I don’t think hypertext is a limiting thing at all – in fact I find it a helpful tool to map out connections to information. Hypertext, paired with the use of tabs in a window, is what saves me for research papers more than 90% of the time. I think Delaney’s criticism of it being limited is that hypertext back then was reserved for specific things, yet the uses of hypertext now are numerous. </p>
			<p style="margin-left: 10%">iv. I hate to scare you, but it has actually been 21 years since this was made, and I only know because I was born in ‘99 and am eagerly waiting for my 21st. The biggest concept brought up in this conversation that remains true (and is in fat, a very important topic now) is the spread of misinformation. The presidential election of 2016, as well as the years after, have been a highlight in the eyes of many about the spread of misinformation. The term “fake news” has created a rift in the public sphere in what people trust out of the media. The sad part is: many people just believe what they want to believe. And the internet is really effective at giving people access to many different opinions at once, which allows them to choose what they want as fact. The intellectual fervor over the past few years has been really interesting for me to observe, because it feels very deranged but also I like to think about how it would be if the internet wasn’t here. And the truth is: I can still see there being a problem of misinformation. The problem comes from power structures existing online in the same way as they do in real-life.</p>

			<p style="margin-left: 10%">Firstly, as a writer, I did not enjoy that article. However, I do understand more of what’s taken into consideration when a web designer creates a website. I have always been interested in web design – I played around with Tumblr a lot when I was in early highschool, and taught myself some light coding in order to change around my profile. I’m hoping that moving forward, I will learn how to add more “cool” elements to my website, like moving pieces and animations. I also have no reason to believe why a website cannot also be a sculpture, so I’m hoping to approach some of my web creations with that same mindset. 

			Sam wrote a section about accessibility that was half-old and half-new information to me. For example, I hadn’t truly considered about what can be done for colorblind users, or users who have other visual impairments. The only few times I’ve seen accessibility considered on major websites is text-to-speech on twitter and instagram, and map recolorings/texturing for color-blind users. I’m interested in how I can make a website be artful and fit my own vision but still be accessible for people who need adjustments. Perhaps it’s something I’m even excited for.
